A few years ago,I feel like a stack a lot.

so I decide to follow in the foodsteps of greate american philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, 
and try something new 30 days.
A idea is actually pretty simple.
Think about something youve always wanted to add to life.
try it next 30days.
I turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time 


for your life


The first was instead of the months flying by forgotten
the times was much more memoriable.

this was challange I did  to take a picture every day for a month.
And I remember exactly where I was and doing at day.


I also know this that I started do more and hareder 30 days.

I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd.

to kind of guy who bikes to work.
 

for fun.


Even last year, I ended hiking up a Killimangaro.
